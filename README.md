# Attitudes on Climate Change & Air Quality in European Cities

A compact exploratory analysis of public attitudes toward **climate change** and **air quality** across European cities. The project combines a structured dataset with a reproducible Jupyter notebook and a short report.

## Project Goals
- Explore distributions and cross-city variation in attitudes.
- Examine potential relationships between perceptions of air quality and climate opinions.
- Produce quick visuals and a concise write-up.

## Repository Structure
- `Dataset.csv` — primary dataset (tabular).
- `Group_I_notebook.ipynb` — analysis notebook.
- `Group_I_project.pdf` — short project report.
  
## How to Run
1. **Environment**
   - Python 3.10+ recommended
   - Install: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter`
2. **Start Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Group_I_notebook.ipynb
# Methods & Metrics

Descriptive stats, grouped comparisons

Basic visualizations (bar charts, histograms, heatmaps)

Simple correlation checks

# Results (at a glance)

Notebook visuals summarize variance in attitudes across cities and potential association patterns with perceived air quality.

# Next Steps

Add regression analysis (e.g., OLS or logit)

Robustness checks and missing-data handling
